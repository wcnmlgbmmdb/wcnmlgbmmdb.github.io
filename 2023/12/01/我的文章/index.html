<p>The power of the fight, three sections</p>
<p>Looking at the five big characters on the test magic stone tablet, which were shiny and even a little dazzling, the young man was expressionless, there was a touch of self-deprecation at the corner of his lips, and his clenched palms were clenched, because of the strength, causing the slightly sharp nails to pierce deep into the palms, bringing bursts of pain</p>
<p>Xiao Yan, Dou Zhi, Three-stage Level: Next to the low-level test magic stone tablet, a middle-aged man glanced at the information displayed on the tablet, and announced it in an indifferent tone</p>
<p>As soon as the middle-aged man blurted out his words, it was no surprise that there was a commotion of ridicule in the crowded square.</p>
<p>Three paragraphs hehe, as I expected, this genius is standing still again this year</p>
<p>Hey, this waste has really disgraced the family’s face.</p>
<p>If it weren’t for the patriarch being his father, this kind of waste would have been driven out of the family a long time ago and left to fend for itself, how could he have the opportunity to stay in the family and eat and drink for nothing.</p>
<p>Alas, how did the genius boy who heard Wutan City in the past become like this now</p>
<p>Who knows, maybe he did something bad to provoke the wrath of the gods</p>
<p>The disdainful ridicule and regretful sighs from around him fell on the ears of the young man who was staying in place like a wooden stake, like sharp thorns piercing the heart, making the young man’s breathing slightly short.</p>
<p>The young man slowly raised his head, revealing a somewhat delicate and immature face, his dark eyes swept over the mocking peers around him, and the self-deprecation at the corner of the young man’s mouth seemed to become more bitter.</p>
<p>These people, are they all so mean Maybe it’s because they had shown the most humble smile in front of them three years ago, so now they want to ask for it back A bitter smile, Xiao Yan turned around lonely, and quietly returned to the last row of the team, a lonely figure, a little out of place with the world around him.</p>
<p>Next, Xiao Mei</p>
<p>Listening to the shouts of the testers, a girl ran out of the crowd, the girl just appeared, and the nearby discussion was much quieter, and a pair of slightly fiery eyes firmly locked the girl’s cheeks</p>
<p>The girl is only about fourteen years old, although it is not stunning, but the childish little face contains a touch of charm, purity and charm, a collection of contradictions, so that she has successfully become the focus of attention of the audience</p>
<p>The girl stepped forward quickly, touched the dark magic stone tablet with her little hand, and then slowly closed her eyes</p>
<p>After the girl closed her eyes for a moment, the pitch-black magic stone tablet lit up again</p>
<p>Fighting spirit: seven paragraphs</p>
<p>Xiao Mei, Fighting Qi: Seven-stage Level: Advanced</p>
<p>Yay listened to the tester’s shouting of the results, and the girl’s cheeks raised a smug smile</p>
<p>Tsk, the seven-stage fighting qi is really amazing, according to this progress, I’m afraid it will only take three years at most, and she can be called a real fighter</p>
<p>It’s worthy of being a seed-level figure in the family</p>
<p>Listening to the bursts of envy from the crowd, the smile on the girl’s cheeks was even more a little more vanity, which is a temptation that many girls can’t resist</p>
<p>Laughing and talking with a few sisters on weekdays, Xiao Mei’s gaze suddenly stopped at the lonely figure outside the crowd through the surrounding crowd</p>
<p>Frowning and thinking for a moment, Xiao Mei still dispelled the idea of the past, the current two are no longer above the same class, with Xiao Yan’s performance in recent years, when she becomes an adult, she can only be a lower-level member of the family at most, and she has excellent talent, she will become a strong person cultivated by the family, and her future can be said to be unlimited.</p>
<p>Alas inexplicably sighed lightly, Xiao Mei’s mind suddenly appeared in the high-spirited young man three years ago, practicing qi at the age of four, having the qi of the nine-stage bucket at the age of ten, breaking through the qi of the ten-stage bucket at the age of eleven, successfully condensing the cyclone of the fight, and becoming the youngest fighter in the family within a hundred years</p>
<p>The original teenager was confident and had immeasurable potential, and I don’t know how many girls were excited about it, of course, this also included the previous Xiao Mei.</p>
<p>However, the road of genius always seems to be tortuous, three years ago, this genius boy whose reputation reached the peak suddenly received the most cruel blow in his life, not only did the Dou Qi that had been cultivated for more than ten years condense into nothing, overnight, and the Dou Qi in his body also became less and less weird with the passage of time.</p>
<p>The direct result of the disappearance of the fighting spirit is to cause its strength to continue to retreat.</p>
<p>From the altar of genius, he fell overnight to the point where even ordinary people were inferior, this blow made the young man lose his soul from then on, and the name of genius was gradually replaced by disdain and ridicule.</p>
<p>The higher you stand, the harder you fall, and this time you fall, you may never have a chance to get up again.</p>
<p>Next, Xiao Xun’er</p>
<p>In the noisy crowd, the tester’s voice sounded again.</p>
<p>As this somewhat elegant name sounded, the crowd suddenly quieted down, and all eyes suddenly shifted.</p>
<p>At the place where everyone’s eyes converged, a girl in a purple dress was standing elegantly, with a calm and immature face, which did not change at all because of everyone’s attention.</p>
<p>The girl’s cold and indifferent temperament, like the first bloom of the Qinglian, at a young age, but has begun to have a refined temperament, it is hard to imagine that if she grows up in the future, how the girl will fall into the country and the city</p>
<p>This girl in a purple skirt, in terms of beauty and temperament, is undoubtedly a little better than the previous Xiao Mei, and it is no wonder that everyone present is acting like this.</p>
<p>The lotus step moved slightly, and the girl named Xiao Xun’er walked in front of the magic stone tablet, her little hand stretched out, and the purple sleeves inlaid with black gold silk slid down, revealing a snow-white and delicate wrist, and then touched the stone tablet lightly</p>
<p>Slightly quiet, on the stone tablet, the dazzling light bloomed again.</p>
<p>Fighting Qi: Nine-stage Level: Advanced</p>
<p>Looking at the font on the stele, there was a silence in the field.</p>
<p>It’s actually the ninth stage, and it’s really the first person of the younger generation in the horror family, I’m afraid it has to be Miss Xun’er. After the silence, the surrounding teenagers all swallowed a mouthful of saliva involuntarily, their eyes full of awe</p>
<p>Fighting qi, the only way for every fighter, the primary level of fighting qi is divided into one to ten sections, when the fighting qi in the body reaches ten sections, you can condense the fighting qi and become a respected fighter</p>
<p>In the crowd, Xiao Mei stared at the purple-dressed girl in front of the stone monument with a frown, and a trace of jealousy flashed on her cheeks</p>
<p>Looking at the information on the stone tablet, the middle-aged tester on the side showed a rare smile on his indifferent face, and said slightly respectfully to the girl: Miss Xun’er, after half a year, you should be able to condense the whirlwind of fighting spirit, if you succeed, then become a real fighter at the age of fourteen, you are the second person in the Xiao family within a hundred years</p>
<p>Yes, the second person, the first person, is Xiao Yan, who has lost the aura of genius.</p>
<p>Thank you. The girl nodded slightly, her plain little face did not show joy because of his praise, she turned around quietly, and then slowly walked to the decadent young man at the back of the crowd under the blazing gaze of everyone</p>
<p>Brother Xiao Yan. When passing by the young man, the girl paused, bent down respectfully at Xiao Yan, and her beautiful face actually showed an elegant smile that made the girls around her jealous.</p>
<p>I am still qualified to let you say what to call Looking at the pearl in front of me that has grown into the brightest pearl in the family, Xiao Yan said bitterly, she is one of the very few people who still maintains respect for herself after she is down.</p>
<p>Brother Xiao Yan, you once told Xun’er before that you have to be able to put it down, so that you can pick it up and put it freely, it is a comfortable person Xiao Xun’er smiled and said softly, her slightly immature voice was heartwarming.</p>
<p>Hehe, I can only say that I am a free person, do you look like a free person now, and this world does not belong to me in the first place. Xiao Yan smiled self-deprecatingly, and said with a smile.</p>
<p>Facing Xiao Yan’s decadence, Xiao Xun’er’s slender eyebrows wrinkled slightly, and said seriously: Brother Xiao Yan, although I don’t know what is going on with you, but Xun’er believes that you will stand up again and take back the glory and dignity that belongs to you At this point, after a slight pause, the girl’s fair and pretty face showed a faint crimson for the first time: Brother Xiao Yan back then was indeed very attractive</p>
<p>Hehe faced the girl’s undisguised frank words, the young man laughed embarrassedly, but he didn’t say anything, people are not romantic, but now he really doesn’t have the qualifications and mood, turned around lonely, and walked slowly outside the square</p>
<p>Standing in place and looking at the lonely back of the young man who seemed to be isolated from the world, Xiao Xun’er hesitated for a while, and then in the jealous wolf howl behind her, she quickly chased after him and walked side by side with the young man</p>
